What is this?
=======

this is the fork of cuckoo monitor, the line below is what I modified (include monitor and host)  
if you want to use new hook only, here is the link : https://github.com/kj5377707/cuckooNewHook (add new hook)  
if you also want to use the modified server. use this link instead : https://github.com/kj5377707/cuckooModifyHost (add parameters to switch different monitor)  
follow the instruction in README

# TODO
fully test for whole monitor  
switch diff hook inside monitor instead of switch itself  
add ring0 hook  
make cuckoo monitor easier to debug
