monitor
=======

this is the fork of cuckoo monitor.  
if you want to use new hook only, here is the link : https://github.com/kj5377707/cuckooNewHook  (replace the file in cuckoo monitor and compile by yourself or use the dll file)  
if you also want to use the modified server(which can user the parameter to switch different monitor). use this link instead :     

# TODO
fully test for whole monitor  
switch diff hook inside monitor instead of switch itself  
add ring0 hook  
make cuckoo monitor easier to debug
